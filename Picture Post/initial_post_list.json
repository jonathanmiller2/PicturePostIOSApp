  "description":"The nearshore of the Guana Peninsula along the Tolomato River in northeast Florida has provided welcoming habitat for the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, over the centuries as documented through findings of large oyster shell middens from pre-Columbian occupation of the area, and from historical record through the late 20th century. In recent years the frequency and density of oyster reefs in the area have dwindled significantly. As in many coastal and estuarine areas, the impacts of over-harvesting, the expansion of human occupancy near the waterways, water pollution, increasing wave action as a result of river traffic, dredging along the Intracoastal Waterway, climate change and sea level rise have reduced the habitat compatibility for these important shellfish and associated species. The value of oysters goes far beyond their place in the diet of humans and many animal species. Oyster reefs provide protective important shelter and nursery habitat for many fish and invertebrate species, protect nearby shorelines from erosion, and help to reduce suspended particulates and turbidity within the water column by feeding on phytoplankton and suspended detritus. The disappearance of oyster reef along the southern portion of the Guana Peninsula has created a domino effect of environmental destruction, with the elimination of the reefs contributing to the breakdown of the Spartina alterniflora salt marsh, and the disappearance of spartina allowing shoreline erosion to eat away at the upland habitat as well. The responsible management of the reserve's diverse habitats, plants and animals is a primary role of the GTM NERR, including restoration and conservation of habitat to support the reserve's resident plants and animals which include more than 1,300 species. Of these species, eight plants and 48 animal species have been listed as endangered, threatened or of special concern. Included in the fragile species found in the GTM NERR estuaries which could benefit from the restoration of oyster reef nursery habitat are Shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum - endangered), Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus, candidate for listing), and the Opossum pipefish (Micropphis brachyurus, species of concern).",

Some time ago, the previous owner had built a berm along the shoreline, filling the tidal marsh with construction debris.  The City has removed the berm and regraded the shoreline (5-03-2010) and is working with restoration scientists at the Jackson Estuarine Laboratory and fifth grade students and teachers at the New Franklin School to restore the tidal marsh.  Funded by the City, US Fish and Wildlife Service, Partners for Wildlife, and the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation.",

  "description":"The Thain Family Forest is the largest remnant of original forest that once covered most of New York City. When you visit the Forest, you will walk along Native American hunting trails, see marks left by glaciers, and pass under trees dating back to the American Revolution. For thousands of years, this old-growth Forest has changed, adapted and survived. Today the Forest remains a magnificent reminder of the beauty and resilience of nature in the face of complex human-caused disturbances. Research has shown that over the past century pollution, soil compaction, and the introduction of invasive plants, pests, and diseases have all impacted the health of the Forest. To preserve the Forest for future generations the Garden manages invasive species, plants native species, and performs research. Monitoring the impacts of climate change on the local flora is one of the on going Citizen Science research projects at the Garden. Volunteer Citizen Scientists have been monitoring the phenology of native plants in the Thain Family Forest for nearly a decade. Thank you for helping with our efforts to monitor phenology changes in the Forest. To learn more about the Forest please visit http://www.nybg.org/gardens/thain-family-forest/index.php",

Anyone can take a panorama of photos and one shot of the sky (UP) and then look for the QR code on the signage. The QR code will take them to the webpage, built as an explanation of the process, which will also link to the collection of our photos of Wells Harbor. This will be a powerful display of how all of us can contribute to sharing data that can be used over time. The Wells Harbor Post is unique in that it is a working harbor, a recreational fishing and boating harbor, a NOAA weather station and a beautiful place in Maine.",
